Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. \n\nAlthough appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.  \n\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.  \n\nShe is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naiveté. The surname \"Valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city\'s famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: “we deceive or we are deceived”, and that “nothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.”  \n\nThroughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the “only place I could return to”. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b2-0Iszg6Izgt4p.png","2023-05-07 22:13:31.024","2023-05-07 22:13:31.024",NULL),

She is evidently Edward&#039;s love interest. Specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, Winry services Edward&#039;s arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement. \n\n~!In the manga, Winry becomes an apprentice to Garfiel, an automail engineer in Rush Valley. She also studies techniques for making automail for northern frigid conditions. Her parents, both doctors, were killed by Scar during the Ishbal war when she was very young. In chapter 47 at the Central, she tried to shoot Scar after finding out that he was the one who had killed her parents. He said, &quot; You have the right to shoot me. Know this. However, should you decide to open fire, you henceforth damn yourself as my enemy.&quot; Ed made her lower the gun after fighting with Scar and said, &quot; Your hands are not meant to be used for killing. They&#039;re meant to Save those in need.&quot; She frequently travels with the Elrics in earlier chapters and later, returning back to Rush Valley, realizes that she has been in love with Ed for a long time, and Ed has the same feeling though he constantly denies it.\n\nIt has been mentioned in chapter 15 that Alphonse and Edward had once fought over who\'d get to marry Winry when they were kids, making Ed freak out and become incredibly flustered, claiming that he didn\'t remember that. Alphonse won, but was rejected. After Ed asked her why, she replied with \"I don\'t like guys shorter than me\" resulting in a huge blow on Ed\'s ego.    \n\nDue to her importance in the lives of the Elric brothers, Winry is used as a hostage by the military to gain Edward\'s obedience. In order to escape from the military\'s possession, she decided to travel with Scar and the others. It was revealed in chapter 73 that it was her plan for Scar to use her as a hostage in order to escape although she has not forgiven him for killing her parents. In chapter 84 Winry is taken on a military train back into Resembool in a water tank. When she goes into her house, she is shocked to find Ed in her room while she is undressing. They both scream which causes everyone to believe that the two of them are in danger. Shortly afterwards (after beating his head a few times), she fills Ed in on where Al is and what\'s been happening in Lior. Ed tells her to leave the country, but she refuses, wanting to help Ed in any way that she can. Ed soon departs, and Winry stays in Resembool for the time being.    \n\nAt the epilogue, Ed confesses (or maybe more like proposes) to her, and in a photo, it shown that they are married and have two children!~","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/63-xloedtYxiJ2E.jpg","2023-05-07 22:14:29.814","2023-05-07 22:14:29.814",NULL),

She expands their training with a regimen of philosophy, martial arts, and living off the land. Her methods are derived from her own alchemy training: in the manga and second anime, she was forced to survive in the northern region surrounding Briggs Fortress for a month (although it turns out she succeeded by stealing supplies from the northern fortress), whereas in the first anime she was taught by Dante. She thinks of the Elrics as her own sons, and although she severs her student-teacher ties with them after learning of their attempts with human transmutation (and similarly Ed\'s joining the State Military), she continues to do all she can to help them. She can be quite violent when punishing or sparring with the Elric brothers, so they tend to be deathly afraid of her. Her claim of \"I\'m a housewife!\" while confronting Greed was a favorite scene of Arakawa\'s to draw.  Izumi and her husband Sig Curtis (シグ・カーティス, Shigu Kātisu) were expecting a child years before the start of the series; however, their son was stillborn. Izumi tried and failed to revive the child through human transmutation (an act that created Wrath in the first anime). The failed attempt took some of her internal organs, resulting in infertility, and causing her to periodically cough up blood. Izumi gained the ability to use alchemy without a transmutation circle after seeing the \"truth.\"  In the manga, Izumi attracts the attention of the State Military for surviving the failed human transmutation. As she and her husband travel around Amestris in order to avoid the military, they eventually meet Ed and Al\'s father Hohenheim. He rearranges her insides to ease the blood flow, and persuades her to help collaborate in bringing down the State Military.","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b67-ggB3aC6DzQqB.png","2023-05-07 22:18:35.618","2023-05-07 22:18:35.618",NULL),

Riza and Roy seem to share a close relationship in both adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist; in the anime she identifies him as her most precious person, whereas in the manga she loses her resolve to live when believing he has been killed. Riza specializes in firearms, particularly sniper rifles, and can hit nearly any target with lethal accuracy.

She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past, although portions can be pieced together through the series. Revy is a Chinese-American born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, spending most of her youth as a thief and murderer. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that Revy may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting her father while using a pillow. It is unknown whether the pillow was used to suppress the noise or to help avoid looking at her first victim.\nShe shot him as a result of being fed up with the abuse.\n~!In the 3rd season, it is revealed that she was also raped in a jail cell!~ Revy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she\'s revealed to be highly ticklish.  Revy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis\' boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.  She has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda\'s teasing, which appear to be jealousy.  According to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf\'s Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.  Revy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat. Her weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS\'s; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hands\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.  Constantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b458-tlKqPcuR287U.png","2023-05-07 22:16:12.057","2023-05-07 22:16:12.057",NULL),

In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.  As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would\'ve gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b558-8tSMZ4a0LWrn.jpg","2023-05-07 22:13:40.920","2023-05-07 22:13:40.920",NULL),

She is the first Homunculus to appear in the series and plays a significant role in the plot of both the manga and 2003 anime series. Lust is also usually partnered with Gluttony to whom she appears to have a particular almost motherly closeness. Her Ouroboros mark is located on her collarbone, just above her breasts.     \n\n __In the 2003 anime series;__  She is largely the same as her manga counterpart, highly intelligent, manipulative, devoted to her own ideals, however she begins to crave becoming a human as the series progresses. Her main purpose amongst the Homunculi is gathering information and traveling abroad, manipulating alchemists into creating Philosopher&#039;s Stones. Gaining true humanity is the focal point of her ambition, arguably much more so than the rest of the Homunculi.     \n\n~!Lust was created by Scar&#039;s brother, when he attempted to use alchemy to bring his lover back from the dead. After he was cast out from Ishbalan society as a heretic, Envy visited the wretched creature and fed it red stones, giving her human shape, and her new name. She was not the first Homunculus to bear the name of Lust, and is the third youngest Homunculus.!~\n\n __In the manga and 2009 anime series;__  Lust is the only female Homunculus and the second to be created by Father. Due to her high intelligence and devotion to Father&#039;s plan, Lust appears to have a great deal of free reign and authority within the organization, seeming to have a position second only to Pride and on par with Wrath. Lust also has a great disdain for humans, thinking them frail, predictable and generally stupid. Moreover, she appears to take pleasure in using and throwing them away. Lust is the first to introduce the idea of Homunculi as superhuman, the next wave of evolution of humanity, and takes pride in her nature.    -Taken in part from Wikia.","/assets/650.png","2023-05-07 22:18:37.835","2023-05-09 00:28:00.612","/assets/650.png"),

She has short black hair (blue highlighted in the anime) and brown eyes. At the beginning of the series, she had long hair but had it cut short. She usually wears the girls\' uniform for Furinkan High School but has a wide variety of outfits. For training or anticipated combat, Akane wears a light yellow gi and is barefoot.\n\nWhile Akane is generally shown as compassionate and helpful towards anyone in trouble, she\'s also a vulnerable, stubborn, relentless, and very short-tempered girl. She frequently becomes angry and jealous, and is apt to hit Ranma, often a reaction to Ranma\'s own bad traits like his smart mouth and insensitivity, but also due to rampant paranoia and willingness to generally believe the worst of the situations she finds him in. Despite her temper, Akane has a more prominent gentle side. She has come to the aid of her rivals, even consistently feeling compassion towards or helping people who try to make her life miserable. Most of her flaws can be attributed to insecurities about her own attractiveness, skill, or lack of traditionally feminine talents.\n\nAkane\'s [mother](https://anilist.co/character/58357/Mrs-Tendo) died when she was very young. She\'s been raised by her eldest sister, [Kasumi](https://anilist.co/character/3665/Kasumi-Tendo), and her father, Soun (likely the source of her missing traditionally feminine skills).

She once referred to herself as \"Derringer Meryl\".  Initially, she finds Vash to be a nuisance and dismisses the idea that he is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon. As time passes, she realizes that Vash isn\'t the villain that he is made out to be nor the buffoon that he presents himself to be. Gradually, she comes to respect Vash and love him deeply.  It is also hinted near the end of the anime that she may possibly be the reincarnation of Rem Saverem. This, however, is not present in the manga, and may have been an independent decision by the producers of the anime. Another source of this belief is through the construction of her name, where as Meryl = Mer-yl = Rem  It is hinted that Meryl has problems involving her family.

Although her initial purpose is to help Yusuke cross over to the Spirit World, or Reikai, Botan eventually becomes a sort of guardian angel to Yusuke, helping him in his efforts to return to his body, and when Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective, being the liaison between Yusuke and friends, and Koenma in Reikai.

She has no spirit powers like Yusuke\'s Rei Gun or Kuwabara\'s Spirit Sword, but she possesses heightened spirit awareness and spiritual energy (as can be determined by her ability to use the detective tools, which require spirit energy in order to work.) Typically, when Botan fights, she tends to favor blunt instruments like her oar, a metal bat, or, if all else fails, her fists. In her human form, Botan can use any of Yusuke\'s detective items.

She loses all sense of empathy, killing without much concern, and acts somewhat sadistic, often torturing victims before killing them (such as Bandou and Nana, though she failed in killing them both). Towards the end of the series, however, she begins to show remorse for her actions, mainly towards Kohta, who lost his father and sister to her. Kohta was Lucy\'s childhood friend, though she didn\'t trust him when they first met. As they became friends, Lucy starts to have feelings towards him. She kills Kohta\'s  father and sister out of jealousy when Kohta goes to a festival with his cousin Yuka, which causes Kohta immense mental trauma that makes him forget about her and his cousin.!~\n\n~!At the end of the manga it is revealed that her real name is Kaede.

Her name, \'Nana\', is Japanese for the number seven, the number by which she was called at the research facility (\"Nana\" is also a fairly common female name in Japan). Most diclonius babies are euthanized at birth in sweeps of hospital maternity wards, but Nana was one of a handful kept alive for use as a test subjects; as a result she has spent her entire life in the diclonius research facility. Kurama sees her as his daughter and cares very much for her. In an attempt to recapture Lucy, Kurama sent out Nana to find her (diclonii can telepathically sense each other), then retreat until Kurama could arrive with soldiers, but Nana wanted to impress Kurama so she tried to capture Lucy herself. Lucy and Nana engaged in a brutal telekinetic battle that ended with Lucy tearing all of Nana\'s limbs off. Kurama personally came to stop Lucy and save Nana, then also disregarded Director General Kakuzawa\'s order to kill her by giving her new prosthetic limbs and setting her free with a lot of money. Unlike many other Diclonius, because Kurama treated her with kindness, she is not homicidal or sadistic. She has the ability to temporarily disable other Diclonius\' vectors by having her vectors go through their pineal gland. Although her vector power is slightly superior to Lucy\'s in terms of range (3 meters to Lucy\'s 2)and certain abilities, she lacks Lucy\'s sheer strength (Lucy can lift and throw many more heavy objects than Nana can), and violent nature: Nana\'s empathy for others does not allow her to fight as vigorously, and she loses her arms and legs when she is viciously dismembered by Lucy. With her vector arms, she is later able to manipulate prosthetic appendages and even throw them like a rocket punch.  Nana can be seen as the exact opposite of Lucy. While Lucy\'s default personality is serious and cold, Nana\'s is friendly and kind; Lucy\'s split personality \"Nyu\" is similar to Nana\'s default while Nana sometimes goes into trances and acts cold like Lucy\'s default personality. Nana is in the middle of the spectrum of Lucy\'s split personalities: she\'s not as mature as Lucy, but more mature than Nyu.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b740-ODhefJgbwzMK.png","2023-05-07 22:15:20.536","2023-05-07 22:15:20.536",NULL),

Lelouch believes that she may be able to see again someday. After the confrontation of Lelouch with the Emperor of Britannia about the murder of their mother, both Lelouch and Nunnally were sent to Japan as political trade. They then went on to live in Kururugi Residence where she first met Suzaku Kururugi.\n\nAfter Britannia invades Japan, Lelouch hides their identity in fear of their safety and changes their surname to Lamperouge. They then seek help from Marianne\'s old allies, the Ashford family, who kept their identity a secret and allows the two siblings to live in a building on campus to accommodate her disabilities.

She also doesn\'t age. Apart from her immortality, C.C. has the ability to bestow people with the power of Geass, which manifests differently in each person but generally carries the ability to affect the minds of those it is used on in some way. The Geass sigil glows on her forehead whenever she manifests this power, and she has a similar scar on her left breast. It is hinted that many more like her exist, as shown in her memories of many children with similar sigils, and she suggests that the power has precipitated bloody conflicts in the past. Her powers caught the interest of Britannia, who imprisoned her for experimentation purposes.<br>\n\n~!Before she gained the power of Geass, C.C. was a ten-year old escaped slave. A church nun gave C.C. the power of Geass, making everyone around her fall in love with her. Once C.C.\'s power evolved to its highest point and she grew tired of all the proposals and gifts, the nun transferred her immortality to C.C., allowing her to die while leaving C.C. in the position of repeating the cycle.  In the first season finale, C.C. triggers a trap set by V.V., causing herself and Lelouch to be submerged in a shock image sequence similar to the one she used on Suzaku. Through this, Lelouch sees memories of her past, including repeated \"deaths\". One shows C.C. attempting to escape from a battlefield, only to be shot in the forehead. Further memories show her being persecuted as a witch and suffering various forms of torture and/or execution throughout history and various time periods, including burning at the stake, guillotining, and the iron maiden. This would suggest a minimum lifespan of at least six centuries. In a special feature included in the series\' fifth DVD, she and Lelouch discuss Washington\'s Rebellion, during which she speaks of participants such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as if she had been close friends with both. In the past, she appears to have observed Suzaku and Lelouch when they were both children, having even interacted with Lelouch at one point, though he doesn\'t remember their meeting.!~<br>\n\nHer individual experiences have led C.C. to become a detached and lonely individual, with little care for even those she has entered into contracts with, while in the past she was somewhat a spoiled and cheerful girl. She tells Lelouch that she has been alive so long that she can no longer remember who loves her and who hates her. Due to her nature and history, she has been lonely as long as she can remember. Lelouch replies, \"You\'re not alone. We are partners. If you are a witch, then I shall become a warlock.\" Lelouch is possibly the first person that has ever truly cared for her and it appears that she reciprocates at least some of these feelings, as she unexpectedly kisses him after their memories are shared.<br>\n\nC.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut\'s (which sponsors the show in Japan, though the logo is blurred out in the English dub); she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch\'s house using his credit card. She also carries around a stuffed toy of \"Cheese-kun\", the company\'s mascot in Japan. Her love of pizza is often used for comedic effect, as she was twice willing to risk capture simply to get a piece of a giant pizza being made by the Student Council (which is ruined both times); she doesn\'t trust Lelouch to retrieve it for her. Both Lelouch and Kallen sometimes refer to her as \"Pizza Girl\".<br>\n\n~!When left alone, she has sometimes spoken to a previously unknown person through means unknown, which, in episode 23, was revealed to be Marianne, Lelouch\'s deceased mother, although in episode 19 it appears that she is talking to V.V. as well.

Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan\'s heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi\'s care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn\'t care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata\'s lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.  In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam\'s preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki\'s encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto\'s words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.  Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn\'t hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan\'s sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent\'s chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime\'s Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō?), a combination of the Hyuga clan\'s most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.","/assets/hinata.jpg","2023-05-07 22:19:46.811","2023-05-09 00:28:01.316","/assets/hinata.jpg"),

It is soon apparent that even Fate does not know why she is looking for these specimens of Lost Logia (the series\' term for ancient magical artifacts), but she does not care, stating \"I must get them, because my mother wants them.\" Fate is not impressed by her young, naive rival, Nanoha, and tells her that her quest is worthless, but Nanoha\'s steadfast dedication to reforming Fate gets to her heart, and she begins to wane. However, this does not impress Fate\'s mother, Precia Testarossa, who tortures the girl just for not getting all the Jewel Seeds. Fate remains loyal despite Arf\'s protests; she remembers a time when Precia was kind and stable, and thinks that the Jewel Seeds will cure her mother\'s insanity. Fate teleports to her home from the top of an office building with complicated coordinates and a bit of magic. She lives in a gloomy hideout in the Garden of Time with her mother and Arf, sharing a room with the latter. She appears in the city whenever she senses a Jewel Seed, as she has no school and nothing else to do. This is also the reason why she spends much of the series transformed.   ~!Late in the series, Arf finally strikes out at Precia, and is thrown out as \"useless\". Fate finally starts to question her mother\'s motives, as Arf has always been there for her, but still refuses to join Nanoha and accepts her challenge to a winner-takes-all battle for the Jewel Seeds. When Fate loses, Precia appears and steals the Jewel Seeds. Fate tentatively joins up with the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and it is revealed that her memories of the past were copied, and that she is a clone of Precia\'s biological daughter, Alicia Testarossa. Fate doesn\'t take this news too well, but attempts to convince Precia to give up; the madwoman laughs in her face, states that the Jewel Seed collection was an attempt to reach the legendary Al Hazard and resurrect Alicia, and snaps that ever since Fate\'s creation, Precia has despised her. Fate, still hurt, attempts to save Precia, but is rejected as Precia and the preserved body of Alicia fall into a dimensional rift. Fate accepts Nanoha as a partner and a friend, and though she is arrested for what she did for Precia, promises to come back as she will probably be acquitted of all charges.  In A\'s, Fate and Arf join the Time-Space Administration Bureau and go to Earth to team up with Nanoha again. Their new mission is to prevent the Wolkenritter from stealing mages\' Linker Cores (power source) for their Book of Darkness. Nanoha introduces Fate to her friends as a transfer student, and Fate has to get used to civilian life, cell phones and having a new mother figure in Lindy Haraoun. Early on in the season, Bardiche is upgraded to be able to compete with the Wolkenritter\'s weapons, and is renamed \"Bardiche Assault\". Nanoha and Fate meet a sickly girl, Hayate, whom both they and the Wolkenritter wish to save. At this point, Suzuka and Alisa discover Nanoha\'s true identity. Fate is captured by the Book of Darkness and thrown into a dream from which she will never want to wake; a happy life with older sister Alicia and a sane, kind Precia. However, Fate remembers that her friends need her, and says a sad goodbye to the life she always wanted in favour of the life she has. With the help of the Wolkenritter and Hayate herself, they cure both Hayate and the Book of Darkness, which transforms into Reinforce, Hayate\'s partner and weapon.  In an epilogue taking place six years later, Fate is older, has been adopted by Lindy, and working for the TSAB along with Nanoha and Hayate. She has changed her name to Fate T. Harlaown, the T presumably an abbreviation for Testarossa.  In StrikerS, Fate is a 19-year-old commissioned officer of the TSAB. She lives on Earth in Uminari City with Lindy, who has retired from her position as Admiral, having had too much excitement and seeking a desk job. Fate goes to school with Nanoha, Hayate, Suzuka, and Alisa. Though early promotional material suggested that she would abandon her battle uniform for a TSAB suit, a recent update of the nanoha.com website showed her in her Barrier Jacket, which appears to have grown to continue to fit her. She also seems to have gained a white cape, according to two promotional pictures; what the cape is for is unknown. In the manga, both the TSAB uniform and the Barrier Jacket are used with the Barrier Jacket overlaying or replacing the uniform when activated for combat situations.

As village champion, Shampoo challenges them. Ranma defeats her, but according to Chinese Amazon tribal laws, if a female Amazon is defeated by a female outsider, she must give the outsider the \"Kiss of Death,\" hunt her down to the ends of the Earth, and kill her. Ranma and Genma escape, and settle down in Nerima, Japan.  Tracking Ranma to Japan, Shampoo encounters the male Ranma, who stops her from attacking Akane by knocking the ball off her bonbori and knocking her out. And if a female Amazon is defeated by a male outsider, she has to marry him. So she continues on the path of trying to marry male Ranma and kill female Ranma, until Ranma tricks her into thinking that the male side is a disguise for the female side.  She returns to China to undergo specialized training from her great grandmother Cologne. It is at this time she falls into the Cursed Springs and receives her cat curse.  Learning that Ranma is cursed as well, she goes back to Japan to marry him. She works with her great grandmother at the Neko Hanten as a waitress/cook/delivery girl.  At first glance, Shampoo might seem like a bimbo, due to her simplified mode of speech, but she\'s also had a limited amount of time to learn the Japanese language, after pursuing Ranma to his home country. This tendency may be exaggerated in western translations, although her grammar isn\'t shown to improve after her second appearance, while she was presented as speaking fluent Chinese during a rooftop talk with Mousse. In the Memorial Book, Shampoo is described as \'innocent and aggressive,\' which is an accurate summation of the dichotomy of her simultaneously cheerful, open, affectionate, hard-working, spiteful, sadistic, murderous and manipulative personality. Despite her frequently harsh treatment of other people and occasionally even towards Ranma himself, her love for him seems genuine.  Having been trained in the martial art techniques of the Joketsuzoku since birth, with Cologne as her personal instructor and the young female village champion, Shampoo is highly skilled in unarmed combat, particularly involving speed and acrobatics, and is strong enough to casually walk through walls on a regular basis. Despite this, she uses a pair of bonbori as her primary weapons, but is also shown using sword, spear, bow, and a variety of polearms. However, she apparently doesn\'t remotely compare to Ranma himself, and was completely outmatched and effortlessly overpowered the few times she\'s seriously faced him in one-on-one combat.  Beyond basic fighting ability, Shampoo has displayed knowledge of ventriloquism/voice imitation, shiatsu-induced unconsciousness, mind-control or memory loss, sleep-fighting, intuitive multi-step strategy, defense against enchanted herbs, Chinese cooking, and incredible tracking-skills enabling her to hunt Ranma from rural China to the east of Japan. She also has access to minor magic equipment, and is capable of using her bike to literally bounce across the city. Her true strength may lie in sheer versatility.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","/assets/shampoo.jpg","2023-05-07 22:14:46.679","2023-05-09 00:28:01.567","/assets/shampoo.jpg"),

Yukiteru\'s condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno\'s future at all -- her condition, situation, or surroundings — unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru\'s \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries\' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.  Smart, beautiful and diligent — those who don\'t truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki\'s life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus\'s game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.  She is named after the Roman goddess Juno.   ~!Yuno\'s behavior was the result of her parents, who used to be loving parents before becoming demanding and pressuring their daughter to be the perfect citizen to the point they would lock her up in a cage and only allowed her certain amount of time for her to sleep and how much food she ate. Their treatment drove Yuno insane up to the point that she locked her parents in the same cage, hoping they would realize how she felt and change back to their old-selves only for them to die of hunger. To hide her parents\' death, she made a cover story that they were working over-seas but Yuki would later learn about this as well as the truth after Akise investigated the bodies.!~   __MAJOR SPOILER__:  ~!Yuno is actually the \"first Yuno\", after she became God in the game she realized she could not bring Yuki back to life.

As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence\'s wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.  \n\nShe refers to herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu\" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way.

To most people, she is considered a proper lady, but in reality, she has a short-tempered, prideful, and improper attitude with some tomboyish tendencies and insecurities, a fact few other characters know. She is fond of cute, childish things, such as flowery pajamas and Gekota, the popular frog mascot franchise. She has a strong sense of morals and hates injustice, contrary to what she claims.

She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there. Along with her sharp tongue, abusive bluntness and eccentric attitude, she possesses amazing detective skills.   ~!After Victorique saves him from a near-arrest, Kazuya finds himself being entangled in every new mystery. Because her mother was a mistress, and according to Victorique \"a dangerous person\", she was imprisoned in the depths of the de Blois mansion where she developed very un-childlike mannerisms. She was sent off to school under strict orders to never leave the campus (although Grevil sometimes obtains special permission to take her out).

She even ignored him and made fun of him, but gradually warmed up to him and began to trust and cherish him.!~  She enjoys \"reconstructing chaos\" and often complains of the boredom that causes her headaches. Victorique also seems to love sweets, since she\'s always really happy when Kujo gets her anything sweet.  \n\n~!In the end she is shown to have found Kujou\'s family during/after the war and waits with a family member at the place of the returning soldiers.

She is often referred to as \"Tenshi\" by the SSS, based on both Yuri\'s belief that she must be a representative of god and the SSS members not knowing her name initially. Though, they continue to called her as \"Tenshi\" after discovering her real name. Her position often puts her at odds with Yuri and the other SSS members as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and disruptive activities. \n\nHer given name, Kanade, as described by Otonashi, literally means \"Playing music\".\n\nTenshi has a variety of self-defense skills at her disposal, which she calls \"Guard Skills\".   \n\n~! __Hand Sonic:__ Calls forth a blade on one hand or both. The blades are capable of slicing through steel. Kanade has shown several variations to its form:\n-  _Version 1:_ Regular shape, resembling a longsword. \n- _Version 2:_ A longer version than the previous, with a curved diamond shape on its tip. \n- _Version 3:_ Shaped like a traditional sai. \n-  _Version 4:_ A variation which is shaped like a lotus flower with no edges other than, perhaps, its petals. Apparently more of a bludgeoning weapon than a slicing one. Tenshi admits to have created it in her attempt to make her weapon \"cuter\". \n- _Version 5:_ Kanade\'s most recent variation of Hand Sonic. Is basically a pair of pincers secured on the arm by a blue gauntlet-like accessory. She created this version out of Otonashi\'s advice to make a more ruthless image.\n __Distortion:__ Distorts the path of bullets or any other projectiles around or away from her body.   \n__Delay:__ Creates a sort of after-image for close range. It is effective in dodging melee attacks by confusing the enemy into attacking elsewhere.  \n __Harmonics:__ Makes a clone of herself which is identical to her except the clone has blood-red eyes. Clones created through this ability have their own consciousness and have all the abilities of the original - including Harmonics itself. This ability is apparently sightly glitched, as her clones were shown to rebel against her to the extent of almost killing her.  \n __Absorb:__ A reverse of Harmonics. It allows Kanade to reintegrate Harmonics clones back into the original\'s body. However, since every clone has their own consciousness, using this poses some risks. The skill uses a command called timewait, which delays the execution. This was created by Yuri as a method of dealing with the clones.\n__Overdrive:__ A passive ability that gives her superhuman strength.   \n__Howling:__ Emits powerful high-frequency, high-amplitude sound-waves from crossed Hand Sonic blades, meant to make an enemy faint. Created by one of the Harmonics clones.   \n__Angel Wings:__ Sprouts wings from her back that can be used to slow descent and let her survive drops such as jumping from the roof of a building. Purely decorational, as she could survive the drop easily to begin with.   \n__Energy Blast:__ This unnamed technique produces a blue explosion that is shot out of her back in a vaguely angel wing-shaped blast. It was stated to be as powerful as a bomb by Naoi, after it demolished a mass of Shadows. !~ \n\n(Episode 13 spoilers)\n~! It is revealed that Kanade was the receiver of the donor heart from Otonashi. Her regret in life was her inability to thank the one who gave her the heart.

She is the first recruited member of the Neighbor\'s Club and the daughter of Tenma Kashiwazaki, headmaster of St. Chronica\'s Academy. Her wealth, beauty, and outstanding academic and athletic performance have made her popular among male students, and likewise, have made her an outcast among girls. Starting from high school, Sena continuously took first place in all tests, exams, and competitions. A year prior to the start of the story, Sena in her freshman year of high school, won multiple athletic events in the school annual festival. She entered the 200-meter race, cavalry battle, the scavenger hunt race, the obstacle race, the bread-eating race, the marathon, winning all of them effortlessly. \n\nBefore joining the Neighbor\'s Club, Sena didn\'t have any female friends, because she is envied by other girls, due to her good looks and popularity with the opposite sex. Despite being constantly surrounded by boys (who, according to her, are \"doormats\"), all she wants are true friends, which drove her to join the Neighbor\'s Club. Sena shows a dislike of all things \"ordinary.\"  \n\nOn the outside, Sena appears to be an ordinary high school girl, but in truth, Sena is arrogant and prideful by nature and she is well aware of this. Sena considers herself to be the school queen or goddess and so often she treats her male classmates only as servants to be used, although many of them would like to be her boyfriend. Nonetheless, she holds Kodaka to a higher standard. Sena also believes that there are two types of girls; the ones who are willing to be her friends and the others who are not worthy of her. Sena also does not treat the boys in her class with much respect due to them constantly ogling her, and slavishly doing whatever she tells them to. However, whenever Sena\'s ego is shaken by someone (usually Yozora), she bursts into tears and flings childish insults before running away. Sena was surprised to see that Kodaka does not act like the boys in her class (wanting to be stepped on) and hence, views Kodaka in a different light. She first saw him in this different light when he rescued her from some guys who were harassing her at a public pool. Since then, her feelings have increased to the point where she nonchalantly admits that she wouldn\'t mind marrying him and that she is in love with him. Her father was the best friend of Hayato Hasegawa, and because of this, some time in her early childhood Sena met Kodaka Hasegawa (though both of them couldn\'t remember this). \n\nSena enjoys playing video games—including dating sims and eroge—partially because they allow her to make female (if virtual) friends. She is a perfectionist by default. Sena always tries her best at everything and is willing to go to great lengths to do something perfectly (once playing a video game without sleeping until she had finished it). Sena gets so involved in her games that she becomes very angry if they are insulted in any way. She becomes extremely engrossed in things she is interested in, sometimes to beyond reasonable levels (as seen with her grudge against Yozora), while completely ignoring things she is not interested in. She possesses both the confidence and the means to pursue whatever she may desire. Sena is very gullible and often fails to see through the tricks Rika and Yozora play on her, even when the resulting humiliation is plain to see, (an example being the \"heap\" hairstyle). She only realizes her mistake when her father or some other person points it out to her. Yozora calls her \"Meat\" (Niku) an insulting nickname which she secretly likes because it is the first she has ever received. Her father is a friend of Kodaka\'s father, and pulled strings so that Kodaka could attend St. Chronica\'s. \n\nDespite her princess-like arrogance, it\'s been shown that Sena genuinely cares for the other members of the club. ~!For example, Sena offered to purchase a theme park ticket for Maria so that she would not be left out of the group, which showed a degree of care unexpected from an arrogant princess who thinks nothing of others. Later, while she exacted her revenge on Yozora for plagiarizing, Sena made a point not to go too far and offered Yozora a chance to redeem herself by giving her a part in the movie. Sena also has an overly creepy obsession regarding Kodaka\'s younger sister, Kobato, going so far as asking to take a bath with her. Sena will go to any lengths to make Kobato happy, much to Kobato\'s discomfort.!~\n\nIn Volume 7 of the Light Novel,  \n~!it was revealed that Kodaka and Sena are fiancés betrothed by their father\'s which she fully accepts.!~  \n\nIn Volume 8,  \n~!Sena proposes to Kodaka, asking him to marry her. Sena also confesses to Kodaka that she loves him.!~\n\nIn Volume 9,\n~!Kodaka replies to Sena\'s confession. He loves her, but due to the circumstances within the club, he is begging her to be patient. As long the club exists, he doesn\'t want to go out on dates. Sena agrees and the club returns to the old status quo.!~","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b37514-HYTzHG46cgKf.jpg","2023-05-07 22:14:53.279","2023-05-07 22:14:53.279",NULL),

She is the daughter of [Adelt Wogner Kirisaki](https://anilist.co/character/82935) and [Hana Kirisaki](https://anilist.co/character/84919) who served as the fake girlfriend of [Raku Ichijou](https://anilist.co/character/48393) for the next three years of her school life to prevent a war from starting between their families.\n\nChitoge is an attractive and slim fair-skinned young woman with beautiful waist-length blond hair that has pink tips at the end of her hair, strikingly aqua-blue eyes, stunning features and coupled with her height - tall by most standards - and her natural figure, many people associate her with a supermodel. Her most notable feature is the red ribbon that she always uses to tie her hair which was given by [Hana Kirisaki](https://anilist.co/character/84919), which is from when she was quite young, but she still prefers to wear this specific one though her mother has offered to buy her many more. Chitoge is mostly seen wearing her school uniform which is a half-sleeved white shirt with a blue sailor-style collar attached at the lower part of her neck and it connects a thin orange tie that is laced through a loop at the end of the shirt, making a little part of the tie to reach the skirt. The skirt is of fingertip length made out of blue fabric, that is accompanied by thigh-length black socks and brown slip-on shoes. The same uniform style is applied in winter but instead of wearing half-sleeves, she would wear long sleeves. When swimming or going to the beach, Chitoge has her hair in pigtails or ponytail and she would usually wear one of her bikinis. For a swim meet, Chitoge wore the school\'s navy blue swimsuit. Outside of school, Chitoge usually wears blouses, skirts, dresses, small heels, and occasionally, pants. During special events like her birthday party, Chitoge will generally wear an elegant dress with jewelry and her hair done.\n\nChitoge is somewhat a forgetful, stern and bold girl. However, once someone gets to know her better, she becomes very talkative and nice. Similar to Raku, Chitoge is the type to go out of her way to help someone. For example, when Raku lost his pendant once again from the chain being broken, Chitoge had secretly gotten the Beehive gang to help fix it for him and gave it back later that night. Chitoge is somewhat oblivious when it comes to love and others\' love interests, for example, how she didn\'t know what [Seishirou Tsugumi](https://anilist.co/character/58885)’s \"symptoms\" were, which were actually love. She is also very athletic as she can easily jump over the school\'s walls and swim the length of the school pool in a couple of seconds. Ever since she was a child she had a hard time making friends as they disliked her. As a result, she had a cold demeanor toward people at the start of the series due to her relationship with her family. This led her to create notebooks filled with information on classmates in an attempt to make friends. When Chitoge had lost her ribbon, she becomes very emotional and sad, wanting to find the ribbon very badly. Unlike her usual self, when [Marika Tachibana](https://anilist.co/character/66597) insulted her for caring so much about a ribbon, she cried innocently, scaring the girl into speaking in her accent and helping in finding the ribbon. Raku also noted that she felt more womanly as Chitoge was meek and quite happy when he tried to buy a replacement ribbon for her and when she hugged him for finding her actual ribbon, but prefers her usual self better. It should be noted that she treasured the ribbon for two key reasons: because her mother gave it to her, and secondly because Raku told her when they were young that it would look good on her.\n~!In the end of the manga it is shown that Chitoge became a fashion designer and she and Raku got married.!~","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b48391-SuJot8cVKjHj.png","2023-05-07 22:15:02.005","2023-05-07 22:15:02.005",NULL),

She was a student in Class 3-1 of Katagiri Senior High School.\n\n__PERSONALITY__ \nKyouko is moslty a very energetic and popular person who always creates a happy atmosphere around herself. She is a hard-worker in all aspects of her life, and, according to Izumi Miyamura, she scores above 90% for all her tests. When nervous or embarrassed, she tends to switch to a violent state. This is seen when Kyousuke Hori asks if Miyamura was her boyfriend, resulting in her turning red and shoving a hot ladle into his face. Hori truly believes that \"only morons get sick over the summer\". She also appears to be slightly insecure about her loved ones leaving her. This is seen when Izumi Miyamura leaves to get her a sports drink and Hori calls out to him, saying \"Where are you going\". This is due because her mother and father would often be absent at vital times. \n\nEven though Kyouko also gets complimented for being cute, Kyouko does not believe she is cute because she does not get or act scared. She further adds that she doesn\'t do anything cute and how she is hopeless. This is seen when Kyouko abruptly leaves the movie and lays on her bed, believing it was her fault that Miyamura was not attracted to her. \n\nWhen she does ear cleaning, nail clipping, or massaging, she does it aggressively, which makes her feared by her family, her friends, and Miyamura. Miyamura has also mentioned in the chapter―that a Q-tip looks like a weapon with a considerable offense when Hori wields it. Kyousuke also refers to Kyouko as a \"fierce golem\".\n\n~!In chapter 43, or episode 8, it is shown that Hori is a sadist and somewhat of a masochist - however this is only when it comes to Miyamura. Whenever he suddenly flips his personality to that of an abusive boyfriend for a short while (at her request), Hori enjoys the treatment and feels refreshed afterward. This is probably due to the fact that Miyamura is always calm and non-abusive.!~\n\nShe is also shown to be very jealous at times girls are flirting with Miyamura to the point where [Yuki Yoshikawa](https://anilist.co/character/66963/Yuki-Yoshikawa) and [Tooru Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/character/66961/Tooru-Ishikawa) call her \"Ice Queen\". In some parts of the manga, she is also referred to as \"Hannya\" or the \"Goddess of Jealousy\". Over the course of the story, she does not seem to be too bothered with girls talking to Miyamura anymore but instead, worries that he might love a man. She once told him that it\'s okay to love another woman but not a man. \n\n~!In chapter 23, she confirms that she heard Miyamura\'s confession. At the end of the chapter, they hold hands, indicating that they are finally dating.!~ ~!In chapter 37, she calls Miyamura by his first name, \'Izumi\', followed by the scene where they supposedly had sex, as evident in the next scenes, when Miyamura is shown with a bite on his nape as well as Hori being topless with Miyamura.!~\n","https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b66171-o2vk3689wWFK.png","2023-05-07 22:13:17.659","2023-05-07 22:13:17.659",NULL),

She is appointed to supervise Yuuichirou during his suspension from the Japanese Imperial Demon Army for his reckless behavior. She is sarcastic and enjoys teasing others, especially Yuuichirou. \n\nHer Demon Weapon is Shikama Douji (四鎌童子, lit. Four-Scythe Child), a manifestation-type demon weapon which takes the form of a large scythe, but can be condensed into a pen-like object. She can call out the demon, which she fondly addresses as \"Shi,\" inhabiting it out of the weapon to attack an enemy. Her primary ability is to detect anything that comes within the attack radius of her scythe.\n\nDespite being a member of the distinguished Hiiragi family, Shinoa is uninterested in their internal power struggle. Moreover, due to her sister\'s legacy, she is generally shunned by the upper echelon of the army. However, she is loyal to Guren and to the members of her squad. \n\nA childhood lacking in familial warmth left Shinoa with little understanding of the importance of friendship and camaraderie.
